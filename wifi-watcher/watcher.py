class Watcher:

    One Watcher is instantiated during the startup of the wifi-watcher.py
    program.

    The first principle is "First, Do No Harm".
    1. Assume the WiFi router is working until proven otherwise
    2. Don't send power cycle signals without appropriate delays
    3. Give the router time to restart after a power failure.

    Parameters:
        settings (Settings object): settings for wait times, power cycle times
        log (Logging object): the log started in __main__ for logging events
